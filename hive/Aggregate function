/***************************************** AGGERATION FUNCTION ********************************************************/

**Aggregate function return single row based on group of row.
They are commonly used with GROUP BY function and HAVING function to filter the grouping data.

**If we use the Aggregation without GROUP BY entire row in table is considered.

** Some of the Aggregate function are MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG, count

/*Count function while aggregation include null, while rest of the function does not includes it.In hive query, both count(1), count(*) remains same.*/

when to use of group by complusory

1. To do aggregation based on the set of group.
2. In select statement, where we include both aggregate function, along with other column eg.. select count(1),age from emp group by dep;


/********* count ************/

use case : To find the employee who have changed more than one time.

Method 1:

SELECT COUNT(1),EMPLOYEE_ID FROM JOBHIS
GROUP BY EMPLOYEE_ID;

OUTPUT: [EMPLOYEE WITH NO OF JOB CHANGE]

COUNT(1) EMPLOYEE_ID
2	 101
1	 102
1	 114
1	 122
2	 176
2	 200
1	 201

SELECT COUNT(1),EMPLOYEE_ID FROM JOBHIS
GROUP BY EMPLOYEE_ID 
HAVING COUNT(1) >1;


OUTPUT: employee who have changed more than one time

COUNT(1) EMPLOYEE_ID
2	 101
2	 176
2	 200

#GET THE EMPLOYEE DETAILS BASED ON JOBHIS TABLE DATA#
SELECT A.* FROM EMP A
JOIN (SELECT COUNT(1) COU,EMPLOYEE_ID ID FROM JOBHIS
GROUP BY EMPLOYEE_ID 
HAVING COUNT(1) >1) B
ON  A.EMPLOYEE_ID=B.ID;


/******** MAX,MIN *********/

SELECT MAX(MIN_SALARY),MIN(MIN_SALARY) FROM JOBS;

output: display min and max Min_salary in whole jobs table

20080	2008

case: find the min and max salary by department wise.

select MAX(SALARY) AS MAX,MIN(SALARY) AS MIN,JOB_ID AS ID FROM EMP
GROUP BY JOB_ID;

OUTPUT:

MAX     MIN     ID
 
9000 	6900 	FI_ACCOUNT
9000 	4200 	IT_PROG

/**** COLLECT_SET *******/

COLLECT_SET ===> IS SIMILAR TO LISTAGG & COLLECT FUNCTION IN SQL, WHICH USED FOR STRING AGGREATION TECHNIQUE


SELECT COLLECT_SET(JOB_ID) FROM EMP;

OUTPUT:

[CSE,IT,EEE,ECE,MECH]

/**** EXPLODE ****/

EXPLODE ====> SPILT THE ARRAY ELEMENT INTO ROWS;

SELECT EXPLODE(COLLECT_SET(JOB_ID)) AS EXPLODE FROM EMP;

OUTPUT:

EXPLODE
CSE
IT
EEE
MECH
