/***************************** Bucketing *************************/

Bucketing and partition does same job of query performance, but Rule of choosing partition fails ie.,There is Limited number of partion & Comparatively equal size partion. 
Then Bucketing is used, since slicing of data is fixed.

How the bucket is decided based on data:
=======================================

Bucketing is based on the formula :

[Hash functioning on column] mod [total number of bucket]

if the bucketing column is int, we can rightly perdict the bucket. But complex data type are predicatable and decided on hash value .

Advantage of bucketing:
======================

1. Record with same bucket colunm will always store in same bucket
2. Bucket will always creates equally distributed file 
3. During joining two table with both column bucketed , can effiently improves the map-sided join

***** Alter statement is not supported for bucketing in hive, so pre-loaded table data cannot be bucketed

/**** setting for bucketing ****/

set hive.enforce.bucketing=true; ---> number of reducer is decided automatically ,if this command is not used, below command to be used mannulay setting it
           (or)
set mapred.reduce.task=n;-----------> "n" represent number of reducer manually

/**** Creating table with bucketing ***********/
Create EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS emp_BUK (EMPLOYEE_ID TINYINT,
FIRST_NAME STRING,
LAST_NAME STRING,
EMAIL STRING,
PHONE_NUMBER INT,
HIRE_DATE STRING,
JOB_ID STRING,
SALARY INT,
COMMISSION_PCT INT,
MANAGER_ID INT,
DEPARTMENT_ID INT)
CLUSTERED BY (DEPARTMENT_ID) INTO 3 BUCKETS
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/user/cloudera/github_hive/emp_buk';



set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE EMP_BUK
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID ,
FIRST_NAME ,
LAST_NAME ,
EMAIL ,
PHONE_NUMBER ,
HIRE_DATE ,
JOB_ID ,
SALARY ,
COMMISSION_PCT ,
MANAGER_ID ,
DEPARTMENT_ID FROM EMP E;

expected outPut:

##Whole employee data is splited into 3 part, where as during partition data is splitted based in number of unique department_id and split is more comparitively to bucketing.##
